<h2>Text Message Version</h2>

Hi, it's the Cloudcroft Reader. Thank you for supporting us last year. 
December is the BEST time to renew—your $1 becomes $3 through the New Mexico Local News Fund.

As an underwriter, you keep the lights on and the reporting thorough. 
Help us cover village meetings, local issues, and the stories that matter.

Renew before Dec 31: www.cloudcroftreader.com/support
</pre>

<h2>Social Media Version</h2>
<pre>
Last December, YOU underwrote the reporting that kept Cloudcroft informed. 
Now is the BEST time to renew—because your $1 becomes $3 all month long.

When communities lose strong local reporting, participation drops and decisions go unchecked. 
As an underwriter of the Cloudcroft Reader, YOU keep the lights on and the reporting thorough.

Renew your December pledge before Dec 31:

<h2>Email – Main Renewal Version</h2>
<pre>
Thank you for supporting the Cloudcroft Reader last December. Your pledge helped us publish 
more than 200 stories, expand our election coverage, and show up at the meetings where decisions 
are made. Your support didn’t just help — it underwrote the work.

Communities like Cloudcroft need quality local reporting. When no one is watching, information 
gets murky, participation drops, and decisions that affect daily life can happen without clarity 
or accountability.

As an underwriter of the Cloudcroft Reader, you keep the lights on and the reporting thorough.

Right now is the best time to renew because your contribution has triple the impact. For every 
dollar pledged in December, the New Mexico Local News Fund adds two more dollars. Your $1 becomes $3. 
This match ends December 31.

<h2>Email – Final 72 Hours</h2>
<pre>
Thank you for supporting the Cloudcroft Reader last December. Because of donors like you, Cloudcroft 
had clear, factual reporting all year.

We’re in the final days of the triple match. For every dollar you renew before Dec 31, the New Mexico 
Local News Fund adds two more. Your $1 becomes $3.

As an underwriter, you keep the lights on and the reporting thorough. Communities like ours need strong 
local journalism—without it, decisions go unchecked and the public is left guessing.

season. But communities like ours only stay strong when people stay informed.

As an underwriter, you keep the lights on and the reporting thorough. And December is the best time 
to renew: your $1 becomes $3 thanks to the New Mexico Local News Fund.
